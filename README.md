# Roll-A-Zombie
This was my first foray with using Unity and C# to create video games. I do not own the assets used in this project
they were given to me free for educational purposes. This game is only meant to be played as a demo. I am in no way 
earning any money on this. 

If you want to purchase the assets used you can visit bitgem3d.com. They have some really great assets to use in your
games. They are also on the Unity asset store if you use that platform for game assets.

I am looking for ways to improve the game such as:
1. Start Screen
2. Leaderboard
3. Different Assets
4. An in game store to buy new assets for purely cosmetic use of the game
